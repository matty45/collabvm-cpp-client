This is a work in progress client for CollabVM made in C++, this might not go anywhere. Project is just an excuse for me to get coding again and also to learn Qt.

Plan: Create a full-featured chat-only client, then once that is done, begin to implement the stuff needed to control and view vms.

## Todo:
- [x] Implement VM List UI
- [ ] Multi-server support.
- [ ] Dynamically update the VM list by gathering relevant information from multiple websocket servers. Also keeping track of what VM belongs to which server.
- [ ] Implement VM chat UI.
- [ ] Implement configuration settings. (What servers to connect to, themes, etc.)
